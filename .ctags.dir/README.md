# PLEASE NOTE

Universal ctags has requirements around .ctags files:

- They must have a name preceeding the `.ctags`
- They must be housed in a folder named `.ctags.d` in either the root folder or your HOME dir.

This folder in `dotfiles` has a different name to not confuse `.gitignore`; it should be symlinked as `.ctags.d`
