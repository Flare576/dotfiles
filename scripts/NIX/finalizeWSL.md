# Finalize WSL

During setup a new folder should have been created at C:\\flarescript_temp, and three files should have been downloaded:

   - Windows. Select all font files in the folder, right-click any of them, then pick *"Install"* from the menu.
- JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf
- wsltty-3.1.4.2-install-x86_64.exe (version may differ)

The font is awesome, and wsltty is a terminal for WSL based on Mintty.
**FROM WINDOWS**:

1. Navigate to C:\\flaresscript_temp
2. Double-click JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf to install it.
2. Install WSLTTY.

Once installed, you should see a new "Ubuntu Terminal %" entry in your start menu: Open it.

After it loads, click the logo in the top-left, and choose `Options`.

You'll begin in the *Looks* section; at the bottom, change "Cursor" to "Block"

Next, click *Text* on the left, then the **Select** button next to the current font. In the following dialog, choose:

- Font: JetBrains Mono
- Font Style: Regular
- Size: 14

Lastly, click *Keys* and ensure all of the **Shortcuts** entries are selected. In case a version changes these:
- Copy and Paste (Ctrl/Shift+Ins)
- Menu and Full Screen (Alt+Space/Enter)
- Switch window (Ctrl+[Shift+]Tab)
- Zoom (Ctrl +plus/minus/zero)
- Alt+Fn shortcuts
- Ctrl+Shift+letter shortcuts

Click "OK", and you should be off to the races!
